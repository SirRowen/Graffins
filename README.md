Showcasing my journey in Blockchain &amp; DevOps | Projects, certifications, and open-source learning
# 👋 Hi, I'm Graffins

💡 **Aspiring Blockchain Developer & DevOps Engineer | Binance Academy Certified | Learning by Building**

I’m passionate about **Blockchain, Web3, and DevOps**. My journey started with multiple **Binance Academy certifications**, where I gained strong foundations in **blockchain fundamentals, consensus mechanisms, scalability, Web3, and tokenomics**.  

Currently, I’m focused on building **hands-on projects** to sharpen my skills in:  
- 🔗 Blockchain Development (Ethereum, Solidity, Smart Contracts, dApps)  
- ⚙️ DevOps Tools (GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines)  
- 🌍 Web3 Ecosystems (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Interoperability)

Here are some of the projects I’m working on (and will continue to add):  
1. **Hello Blockchain Smart Contract** – My first Solidity deployment on Ethereum testnet.  
2. **MyToken (ERC-20)** – A custom token with deployment guide.  
3. **Dockerized dApp** – A simple voting dApp containerized with Docker.  
4. **NFT Marketplace (Mini)** – Mint and trade NFTs on Ethereum testnet.
